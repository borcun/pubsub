##About Library

It is a small publisher-subscriber library, which is developed on Fedora OS for Intel x64 architecture.

Message is the basic data model, which exists from topic, time label and payload parts.
Topic is a string and must be unique within your projects. Time label is well-known struct timeval instance,
it's stored as present one, not formatted. Payload part is designed as string since it's just a symbolic
payload. For professional usage, it might be redesigned as generic.

MessageFactory class is a factory generating custom messages, and stores them to prevent regeneration.
Its design is easy-to-use if you know factory design pattern, there is a basic function starts with create
prefix. You may also check examples into example directory.

Publisher and Subscriber classes construct the infrastructure of the library. Message instances created by
MessageFactory are shared from one publisher to many subscribers connected together within a context. Thus,
messaging architecture is one-to-many, but it's open to be extended either.
